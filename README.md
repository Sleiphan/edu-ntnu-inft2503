# Exercises from course 'INFT2503'

This is a collection of my submitted material for the NTNU university course INFT2503.

## Where are the exercises?

Look inside the 'Exercise_*' folders. In each folder, you will find all the files relevant to each exercise, including drawings and writeups.

## Run in devcontainer
The exercises were developed and tested inside an Alpine devcontainer. If you have problems running the exercises, I recommend you to use the devcontainer. It will ensure that you are using the same environment as the developer who wrote the code.

### Do I need to login to Github?
No, you do not.

When building the devcontainer, you are asked to login to your Github account. You can skip this by simply pressing ctrl/cmd+c.

This is a feature to make it easier for contributors (me) to rebuild the environment, and still maintain the uplink to Github. This is an alternative to  moving my own ssh-keys into the container, which is both time-consuming and bad practice.
